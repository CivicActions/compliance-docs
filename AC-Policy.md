# CivicActions access control policy

CivicActions develops, documents, and disseminates to all CivicActions staff the Access
Control Policy which addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, compliance, and procedures to
facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access controls.
The CivicActions Access Control Policy is maintained in the CivicActions compliance-docs
Github repository is accessible to all CivicActions staff.

CivicActions Information Security will review and update the CivicActions Access Control
Policy at least every 3 years and any documented access procedures at least annually.

The CivicActions Access Control Policy covers:

* Access Control (AC)
* Audit and Accountability (AU)
* Identification and Authentication (IA)
* System and Communications Protection (SC)

## Purpose

Limit information system access to authorized users or processes acting on behalf of
authorized users. Enforce "least privilege" methodologies for all system actions.

## Scope

See the [CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

In addition, the CivicActions Information Security will coordinate with CivicActions
client services as needed.

## Procedures

CivicActions gives administrative user roles to employees only after review by
CivicActions Information Security. Reviews of user access rights are performed on a
regular basis (at least twice annually). Employee access privileges are removed upon
termination of their relationship to the company.

Access to client systems and services are defined specifically by the Access Control
Policy for that client.
