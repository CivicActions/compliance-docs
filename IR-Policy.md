# Incident response

See the [CivicActions Security Training](https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01-welcome-to-civicactions/training/security-training/) which covers:

* Awareness and Training (AT)
* Configuration Management (CM)
* Contingency Planning (CP)
* Incident Response (IR)
* Maintenance (MA)
* Media Protection (MP)
* Physical and Environmental Protection (PE)
* Personnel Security (PS)
* System and Information Integrity (SI)

## Purpose

Iteratively reduce both the number of incidents as a proportion of our total information system inventory, and reduce the mean time to recover from incidents.

## Scope

See the [CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Procedures

The CivicActions Security Office organizes incident response training sessions, offered to the whole CivicActions team at least annually, and requires that all CivicActions Operations team members take the training. The training may be led by a Project Manager or a Security or Operations team member.

The CivicActions team [Onboarding Process](https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/08-hr-admin/onboarding-process/onboarding-process/) New Hire Checklist requires that all team members take incident response training within 30 days of joining the team. The training includes a quiz that requires an understanding of the procedures.

If the CivicActions systems or processes change in a radical way, CivicActions Security adapts the incident response training to meet the needs of the new system. CivicActions Security then requires all CivicActions team members to take the training again.

CivicActions Security requires all CivicActions team members to take the incident response training at least once a year.

See IR-2.

CivicActions implements processes to detect and analyze malicious activity within the system platforms. If these processes detect malicious activity, they report the activity to the Operations team.

CivicActions has an [Incident Response Plan](https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/09-security/incident-response-plan/) that documents the procedures that staff should take in the case of an incident.

See IR-4, IR-5, IR-6.

The Operations team implements automated processes such as ClamAV and AIDE to detect anomalies. When these processes detect an anomaly, they escalate an alert to Security Operations team members, often automatically via Slack and/or OpsGenie.

CivicActions' systems automatically store logs so that Operations can access relevant information when investigating a potential incident.

See IR-4 (1), IR-6 (1).

As described in the CivicActions security incident response guide and contingency plan, Operations will notify customers about incidents and potential incidents.

See IR-7.

CivicActions Security has developed an [Incident Response Plan](https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/09-security/incident-response-plan/) to implement incident response capabilities.

The Incident Response Plan is continually reviewed and updated by the CivicActions team. In addition, the CivicActions team updates the IR Guide after it tests the guide, which happens at least annually and after any major system/organizational changes.

The CivicActions team distributes changes to the Incident Response Guide to the whole CivicActions team.

See IR-8.

CivicActions Incident Response directs CivicActions team members to watch out for and immediately report any potential security incident, which includes reporting suspected information spills (such as sensitive or classified information in the wrong places). In the event of a suspected information spill, CivicActions team members follow the reporting process in the CivicActions Incident Response Plan.

The System Owner, Program Manager, and CivicActions Information Security and Technology team members have primary responsibility for implementing the actual response to security incidents, including technical measures.

See IR-9.
